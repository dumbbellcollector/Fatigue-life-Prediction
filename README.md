## üìñ Overview

This project presents an advanced fatigue life prediction system. It leverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to estimate strain-life (Œµ‚ÄìN) and shear strain-life (Œ≥‚ÄìN) behavior for metallic materials. Users can input either standard monotonic tensile properties or the alloy's chemical composition to obtain fatigue life predictions.

**Key Features:**
- **Dual Input Modes:**
    - **Monotonic Properties:** Input E, YS, TS, HB, and Poisson's ratio.
    - **Alloy Composition:** Input wt% of key alloying elements (e.g., C, Mn, Cr, Mo, P, S) to internally estimate monotonic properties.
- Predicts key fatigue parameters: œÉ‚Ä≤f, b, Œµ‚Ä≤f, c (tensile).
- Derives shear fatigue parameters (œÑ‚Ä≤f, b‚ÇÄ, Œ≥‚Ä≤f, c‚ÇÄ) using established conversion methods.
- Generates and visualizes both tensile (Œµ‚ÄìN) and shear (Œ≥‚ÄìN) fatigue curves.
- Employs a hybrid loss function: data-driven for some parameters, physics-guided (e.g., Hardness Method) for others, and incorporates the Coffin-Manson relation.
- User-friendly Streamlit web application for interactive predictions.

üî• Model & Application Highlights

Hybrid PINN Approach: Combines data-driven learning with physics-based regularization (e.g., Coffin-Manson relation, empirical hardness methods for specific parameters).

Flexible Input: Accepts either direct monotonic properties or alloy composition for broader usability.

Comprehensive Output: Provides key tensile and shear fatigue parameters along with full Œµ‚ÄìN and Œ≥‚ÄìN curves.

Shear Parameter Conversion: Implements UTS-dependent criteria (von Mises, Max Principal, Interpolation) for robust shear fatigue estimation.

Accuracy Benchmarking: Performance evaluated against established empirical methods using metrics like 2x scatter band inclusion rate.

Interactive GUI: Streamlit application allows for easy input, real-time predictions, and visualization.
